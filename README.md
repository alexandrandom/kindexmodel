# kindexmodel
Can K-index be used to model temperature data? 
I've in fact answered this exciting question in June 2022 when I was presenting this project in my machine learning class.

I built my linear regression model using ozone layer dataset from UCI Machine Learing Repo (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Ozone+Level+Detection) in which I've found certain correlations. 

Methods and tools used:
- ScikitLearn (linear regression modeling)
- OpenRefine (for data cleaning)
- Matplotlib (plots)
- Numpy

For consistency with the university course programme, code is stored in Jupyter Notebook ml_zaliczenie
